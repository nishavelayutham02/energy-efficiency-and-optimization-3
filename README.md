PHASE 03 : IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT

1.Energy– Aware training:
Energy-aware training refers to structured educational and operational programs aimed at promoting energy-efficient practices within an organization. The goal is to empower employees, management, and stakeholders with the knowledge and tools needed to reduce energy consumption, optimize resource use, and integrate sustainability into daily operations.
2. Sustainable Infrastructure:
Sustainable infrastructure refers to the design, construction, and operation of buildings, systems, and facilities in a way that minimizes environmental impact, optimizes energy use, and supports long-term organizational goals. When integrated with energy efficiency, it ensures that resources are conserved while maintaining high performance and cost-effectiveness.
3.AI Model Development:
The primary feature of the AI-Powered Healthcare Assistant is its ability to assess user symptoms and provide health-related recommendations. In Phase 3, the AI model will be trained and implemented to recognize basic health issues. 
4.Hardware Optimization:
Hardware optimization in energy efficiency focuses on upgrading, configuring, or replacing physical equipment (IT systems, machinery, HVAC units, lighting, etc.) to reduce energy consumption while maintaining or enhancing performance. For organizations, this means improving operational efficiency, lowering costs, and reducing environmental impact through smart hardware choices and configurations.
